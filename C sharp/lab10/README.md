In this lab, I developed a Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) application to manage and display the myCars collection from Lab 9 using a DataGridView control. 

The application enables adding, editing, and removing elements, as well as sorting by column. 

I also implemented functionality for searching collection elements, utilizing LINQ queries and custom classes to extend the existing car and engine models.
