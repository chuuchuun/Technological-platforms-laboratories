This lab involves using LINQ, XML serialization, and XPath to work with a collection of Car objects. 

I created data model classes, performed LINQ queries to manipulate and group data, serialized and deserialized objects to XML, and used XPath to extract and modify data from the XML document. 

Additionally, I generated an XHTML document and modified XML elements.
