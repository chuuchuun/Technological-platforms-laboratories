In this lab, you I worked with C# data models and performed file operations. 

The tasks included creating classes to represent data, implementing LINQ queries for data manipulation, and using XML serialization and deserialization. 

I also practiced modifying XML structures and generating reports, such as creating tables in XHTML format, to display the processed data.
