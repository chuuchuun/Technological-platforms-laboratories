This project involves creating a Java application with Maven (Java 11+) to practice basic multithreading operations, synchronization, and thread-safe resource management. 

The application can perform complex calculations (e.g., getting Fibonacci sequence element by element) in parallel, simulating load with Thread.sleep if needed.
